# Implementation of Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) Algorithm to train a Quadcopter to fly autonomously by teaching the agent to
takeoff, hover and land smoothly using Quadcopter Simulator Environment and ROS VM (Robotic Operating System Virtual Machine) and Multi-Layer Feedforward Neural Network Model with Keras Library

# Problem Statement Description
For this project, the task is to train a Deep Reinforcement Learning agent to control several quadcopter flying tasks, including take-off, 
hover and landing.
